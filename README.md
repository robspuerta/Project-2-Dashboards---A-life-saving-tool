Knowledge for real-time decision making

With new achived milestones comes new unforseen problems, therefore is essential to keep a close eye on our strategy performance so we can make quick adjustment if required, but..

How can we have a quick but meaningfull insight of the key processes performance?

In one hand we have Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are targets that help you measure progress versus your most strategic objectives; and in the other hand, we have Dashboards wich are visual tools that gathers multiple metrics.

If we mix these two, we create a powerfull ally that, as expresed by Forbes magazine, help whole teams to monitor and prevent crisis situations by bringing information in a glance so you can alter business strategy in real time.

Dasboards provide key insights by gathering multiple metrics that teams can take in at a glance and then immediately use to alter business strategy in real time. This way we can have real time data on what is happening and take some actions as required instead of waiting to only realized the damage is already done. 

A great way to collect information is by using a CRM, I expressed some ideas about this topics in here.

A Practical Example with Sales Campaign

As an excersice, I created this Dashboard in Excel to enable leaders to monitor, track sales and uncover trends. In a quick review we have: 
* Sales funnel status per seller
* Sales funnel status per team
* Top performance per team and whole campaign.
* Least performance per team and whole campaign
* Sales by location
* Historical performance per manager

The idea is not to just automatize repetitive task like gathering, cleaning and processing data or even create and send reports, but to chanalize this new available time in tasks that brings value to our customers or the company, like analizing and comming up with new ideas.

This was an educational exercise and You can check and download the dashboars on GitHub/RobsPuerta.
