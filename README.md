With new achieved-milestones comes new unforeseen problems, therefore is essential to keep a close eye on our strategy performance so we can make quick adjustments if required, but...

### How can we have a quick but meaningful insight into the key processes' performance?

On one hand, we have **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** that are targets that help you measure progress versus your most strategic objectives; and on the other hand, we have **Dashboards** which are visual tools that gather multiple metrics.

If we mix these two, we create a powerful ally that, as expressed by [Forbes magazine](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edwardsegal/2021/11/05/how-dashboards-are-helping-to-monitor-manage-and-prevent-crisis-situations/amp/), helps whole teams to monitor and prevent crisis situations by bringing information in a glance so you can alter business strategy in real-time.

Dashboards provide key insights by gathering multiple metrics that teams can use to understand what is happening and take some actions as required instead of waiting to only realize the damage is already done. 

It is important to have a good data structure to collect and process. I expressed some ideas about this topic [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-puerta/).

## A Practical Example with Sales Campaign

As an exersice, I created this *Dashboard* in *Excel* to enable leaders to <ins>monitor</ins>, <ins>track sales</ins> and <ins>uncover trends</ins>. In a quick review we have: 
* Sales funnel status per seller
* Sales funnel status per team
* Top performance per team and whole campaign.
* Least performance per team and the whole campaign
* Sales by location
* Historical performance per manager

The idea is not to just automatize repetitive task like gathering, cleaning, and processing data or even creating and sending reports, but ***to channelize this newly available time into tasks that brings value to our customers or the company***, like analyzing and coming up with new ideas.
